      Interning at GQ was an experience that confirmed my desire to work in a creative field. Knowing very little about graphic design, at the time, I had an incredible opportunity to shadow a Senior Graphic Designer in the Marketing Department. During my time there I worked exclusively with Adobe Illustrator. I collaborated on a project to create a layout of a new page featuring Brett Fahlgren, a stylist for GQ.
